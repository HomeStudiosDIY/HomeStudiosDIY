# Welcome to my channel! ðŸ‘‹

If you're looking to build your own locally hosted Smart Home, you're in the right place. The key focus will be on Home Assistant as the heart of the smart homeâ€”making automation simple, powerful, and private.

My goal is to keep things as beginner-friendly as possible, so you donâ€™t have to waste hours digging through countless videos. Iâ€™ll provide step-by-step written guides and videos to help you get started, along with more advanced guides and videos for when you're ready to dive deeper.

All the code and guides shared is my actual working systems not just demos so feel free to use and adapt them how it best fit your home setup.
